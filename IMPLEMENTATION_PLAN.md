# Book Template Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to extract the build implementation from the `iksnae/actual-intelligence` repository into a reusable template that works as a book writing starter kit.

## Phase 1: Basic Structure Setup

1. **Create basic repository structure**:
   - Set up directories as outlined in the structure diagram
   - Copy core build scripts from `actual-intelligence` repository
   - Create placeholder READMEs with appropriate instructions

2. **Create template book structure**:
   - Set up empty book directory structure with READMEs explaining purpose of each folder
   - Include template files for chapter introduction
   - Add instructions for images, chapters, and other content

3. **Copy and adapt GitHub workflow**:
   - Adapt `build-book.yml` workflow for a generic book project
   - Make language configuration more flexible
   - Add comments explaining customization points

## Phase 2: Documentation & Examples

1. **Create comprehensive documentation**:
   - Write detailed getting started guide
   - Document customization options
   - Create guide for multilingual books
   - Include troubleshooting section

2. **Create simplified example book**:
   - Use a condensed version of "Actual Intelligence" as an example
   - Include example in both English and Spanish to demonstrate multilingual support
   - Include sample images and cover

3. **Document Docker configuration**:
   - Include Dockerfile for `book-builder` image
   - Document how to use the Docker image
   - Provide instructions for running builds locally

## Phase 3: Template Customization & Enhancement

1. **Create customizable templates**:
   - Set up customizable LaTeX, EPUB, and HTML templates
   - Document customization points for styling, layout, and metadata
   - Provide examples for different book styles

2. **Enhance build scripts**:
   - Make build scripts more robust and configurable
   - Add more error handling and validation
   - Improve support for multiple languages

3. **Add configuration file**:
   - Create a `book.yaml` or `book.json` configuration file
   - Allow customization of book metadata, output formats, etc.
   - Document all configuration options

## Phase 4: Supplementary Resources

1. **Create book about using the template**:
   - Write a user guide for the template system
   - Include examples, best practices, and tips
   - Document advanced customization and techniques

2. **Develop complementary tools**:
   - Consider creating additional tools like a chapter generator, image processor, etc.
   - Document how these tools integrate with the main template

3. **Set up template website**:
   - Create a simple website for the template system
   - Include examples, documentation, and resources
   - Provide links to related repositories

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement

1. **Extensive testing**:
   - Test template with different content types
   - Test multilingual support
   - Test different output formats

2. **Gather feedback**:
   - Release a beta version
   - Collect user feedback
   - Implement improvements

3. **Final polishing**:
   - Address any remaining issues
   - Improve documentation based on feedback
   - Release v1.0 of the template

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 10-15 weeks
