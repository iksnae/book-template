## What's Included

This starter kit gives you everything you need to create a professional book:

- Ready-to-use chapter structure
- Professional formatting for all book formats
- Automatic table of contents generation
- Cover page setup
- Publishing to multiple formats with a single command
- Cloud-based build system - no installations required
- Interactive CLI tool for managing builds locally

## How It Works

1. **Set Up Your Book**: Fill in your book details in the simple `book.yaml` file
2. **Write Your Content**: Add your text to the Markdown files in the chapter folders
3. **Publish Changes**: Push your changes to GitHub to trigger the automated build
4. **Get Your Books**: Download beautifully formatted PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and HTML files

## Writing Your Book

Your book content goes in the `book/en/` folder (or other language folders):

- Each chapter has its own folder (`chapter-01`, `chapter-02`, etc.)
- Add your chapter introduction in the `00-introduction.md` file
- Add sections to your chapter in numbered files (`01-section.md`, `02-section.md`, etc.)
- Place images in the `images/` folder within each chapter

## Building Your Book Locally

You have several options to build your book locally:

### Using the CLI Tool

This project uses the `book-tools` package, which provides a powerful CLI for managing your book:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the book
npm run build

# Run in interactive mode
npm run interactive

# Create a new chapter
npm run create-chapter

# Check chapter structure
npm run check-chapter

# Get book information
npm run info

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean

# Validate configuration
npm run validate
```

### Using Docker

You can also build your book using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull iksnae/book-builder:latest

# Run a build in the current directory
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace iksnae/book-builder:latest /workspace/build.sh
```

### Direct Build Script

You can also use the build script directly:

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Automatic Publishing

The process happens automatically without any intervention:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build all formats
3. Your books will be available with beautiful download buttons like these:
