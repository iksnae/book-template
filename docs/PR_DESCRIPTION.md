# Migration to book-tools

This PR completes the migration from the bespoke build system to the standardized book-tools solution, as outlined in issue #18 and the migration strategy in issue #19.

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation Changes

1. **Build Script Migration**
   - Updated `build.sh` to use the book-tools CLI in Docker container
   - Added support for both Docker and Node.js implementations
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing command line options
   - Added automatic Docker detection and prompting

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Updated build workflow to use book-tools in Docker container
   - Updated release workflow to use book-tools in Docker container
   - Added detailed build summaries and artifacts
   - Ensured proper GitHub Pages deployment

3. **Configuration Compatibility**
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `book.yaml` format
   - Ensured directory structure remains the same
   - Kept legacy scripts as fallback for backward compatibility

### Documentation Updates

1. **README.md**
   - Updated with Docker-based approach information
   - Simplified build instructions
   - Added release and customization details

2. **Migration Guide**
   - Created detailed migration guide in `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Documented both Docker and Node.js options
   - Provided backward compatibility information

3. **Legacy Scripts**
   - Added compatibility notice for legacy scripts
   - Maintained scripts for backward compatibility

## Testing

The migration has been tested with:

- Docker-based builds using book-tools
- Node.js-based builds using book-tools
- Different build options (languages, formats)
- GitHub Actions workflows

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Consistency**: Builds are now consistent across environments
2. **Simplicity**: Users can build without installing dependencies
3. **Maintainability**: Features developed in book-tools are automatically available
4. **Docker Integration**: Seamless integration with CI/CD systems
5. **Standardization**: All book projects now use the same underlying build system

## What's Next

1. **Feature Enhancements**: Further improvements will now happen in the book-tools repository
2. **Documentation**: Continue to improve documentation for users
3. **Examples**: Add more examples of using the new system

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes for existing users. The migration maintains backward compatibility with:

- Existing command line options
- Directory structure
- Configuration format
- Legacy scripts

## How to Test

To test the migration:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./build.sh` to build using Docker (if available) or Node.js
3. Check the generated outputs in the `build/` directory
