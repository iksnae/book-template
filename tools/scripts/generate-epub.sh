# This is a placeholder script until the actual implementation is completed

# In the real implementation, this script would:
# 1. Use pandoc to convert the markdown to EPUB
# 2. Apply custom CSS and styling
# 3. Process images and other resources
# 4. Add metadata and cover image
# 5. Generate a table of contents

# For now, we'll just create a simple EPUB-like text file

EPUB VERSION
----------
Title: $BOOK_TITLE
Subtitle: $BOOK_SUBTITLE
Language: $LANGUAGE
Generated: $(date)

This is a placeholder for the EPUB version of the book.
In the real implementation, this would be a properly formatted EPUB document.

The EPUB would be generated from the following source:
- Input file: $INPUT_FILE
- Using resource paths: $RESOURCE_PATHS
