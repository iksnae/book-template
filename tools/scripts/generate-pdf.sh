# In the real implementation, this script would:
# 1. Use pandoc to convert the markdown to PDF via LaTeX
# 2. Apply custom LaTeX templates and styling
# 3. Process images and other resources
# 4. Generate a table of contents
# 5. Add headers, footers, and other formatting

# For now, we'll just create a simple PDF-like text file

PDF VERSION
----------
Title: $BOOK_TITLE
Language: $LANGUAGE
Generated: $(date)

This is a placeholder for the PDF version of the book.
In the real implementation, this would be a properly formatted PDF document.

The PDF would be generated from the following source:
- Input file: $INPUT_FILE
- Using resource paths: $RESOURCE_PATHS

echo "âœ… PDF generation simulation completed successfully: $OUTPUT_FILE"
